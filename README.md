<p>This updated version adds a continuous loop, displaying scores and allowing the user to keep playing until they choose to quit. It also improves the user experience by displaying their choice and the computer's choice clearly. The score is now kept track of and displayed at the end of the game.</p>
<title>The last update</title>
